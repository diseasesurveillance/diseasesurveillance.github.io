    "text": "Welcome to the disease surveillance project!\nWe provide tools to national health organizations that allow them to make the best use of their data to improve the health and quality of life of their populations. Our work primarily focus on surveillance of climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue in Brazil and malaria in Africa.\nWe develop innovative statistical and machine learning methods to help understand the geographical spread of diseases and forecast future cases. Our methods leverage multiple datasets from various sources, including temperature, precipitation, and socio-economic factors. Additionally, we use digital data sources to help determine disease levels in real-time.\nOur project aims to be a valuable resource for decision-makers and the general public seeking information on disease levels in various countries. We also provide researchers useful methods and software tools that they can utilize in their efforts to monitor diseases and guide decision-making in their own surveillance applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: #ShowYourStripes."

    "text": "Dengue is a viral infection that spreads to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species (Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus) mosquito. About half of the global population is currently at risk of contracting dengue fever, with an estimated 100 to 400 million infections occurring annually. Dengue is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, primarily in urban and semi-urban areas.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Dengue incidence.\n\n\n\nAlthough many infections of the dengue virus (DENV) do not show symptoms or only result in mild flu-like illness, some cases can be severe and potentially fatal. Dengue fever does not have a specific treatment. Early detection and timely access to proper medical care significantly reduce the fatality rates associated with severe cases. Preventing and controlling dengue transmission relies on managing the the mosquitoes that act as vectors.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Aedes Aegypti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Vector control efforts."
